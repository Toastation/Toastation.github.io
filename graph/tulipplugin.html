        <h4>FM^3-like dynamic graph drawing algorithm plugin for Tulip</h4>
        
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/Toastation/graph-drawing" target="_blank">Source code</a>
        </p>
        
        <h4 id="description">Description</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to propose a method to compute dynamic graph layouts with the <a href="http://tulip.labri.fr/">Tulip framework</a>. 
        The project consists of the 2 following plugins:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p><em>Incremental</em>: computes the layout of a dynamic graph. The format of a dynamic graph is specified in the later section "Dynamic graph format".</p></li>

        <li><p><em>Custom Layout</em>: computes the static layout of a graph with a force-directed algorithm.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>A Python script (<code>src\morph.py</code>) that runs an animation of a dynamic graph is also available.</p>

        <h4 id="compilingtheplugins">Compiling the plugins</h2>

        <p>Copy all the cpp and header files of the <em>src</em> directory into the externalplugins directory of the tulip sources, and recompile. <br />
        You can also compile the plugins using the script <code>src/comp_*.sh</code>. Make sure that the Tulip bin directory is in your path in order to use the tulip-config command.
        For Windows, you can download the DLL files <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/graph-drawing/files/">here</a>. </p>

        <h4 id="dynamicgraphformatgraphhierarchy">Dynamic graph format (graph hierarchy): </h2>

        <p>In our case a dynamic graph is represented via a certain graph hierarchy in Tulip. <br />
        The root graph must contain all the nodes and edges of the timeline. The subgraphs of this root graph represent the differents steps of the timeline. <br />
        If a node or edge exists in both step i and i+1 of the timeline then it must be the same shared tulip node/edge. <br />
        For now, the direction of the timeline follows the increasing order of the subgraphs id.  </p>

        <h4 id="howtouse">How to use:</h2>

        <ul>
        <li><p>Use the plugin <em>Incremental</em> on the root graph of a timeline. This will compute the layout of all of its subgraphs. The layout of each step of the timeline is stored in the local "viewLayout" property of the subgraphs.</p></li>

        <li><p>Use the script <code>scripts/morph.py</code> on the root graph of a timeline already processed by the <em>Incremental</em> plugin to run an animation of the dynamic graph. The animation stops at each steps so be sure to press continue.</p></li>
        </ul>
