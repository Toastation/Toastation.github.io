## About Me

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="aaa.jpg"> -->

I am a first-year PhD student at INRIA in the [MANAO](http://manao.inria.fr/) team. The goal of my research is to develop new tools and methods to generate in-between images from rough drawings and offer precise and intuitive controls over the dynamics of the animation both in time and space. I was a research intern from Feb. to Jul. 2021 then started my PhD in Oct. 2021.
