## About Me

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="aaa.jpg"> -->

I am a second-year PhD student in computer graphics at INRIA in the [MANAO](http://manao.inria.fr/) team under the supervision of [Pascal Barla]() and [Pierre BÃ©nard]().

My research focuses on computer-assisted traditional 2D animation, more specifically I am developing new methods to design and explore motion from **rough** key drawings. More details can be found [here](https://benardp.github.io/mostyle/).
