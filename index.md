## About Me

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="aaa.jpg"> -->

I am a third-year PhD student in computer graphics at INRIA in the [MANAO](http://manao.inria.fr/) team under the supervision of [Pascal Barla]() and [Pierre BÃ©nard]().

My research focuses on computer-assisted traditional 2D animation, more specifically I am developing new methods to design and explore motion from **rough** key drawings. More details can be found [here](https://mostyle.github.io/) or in the [publication page](/publications).

During my Master's degree, I worked on  geometric deformation for 3D animation with [Camille Brunel](https://camillebr.github.io/).

I am interested in all aspects of computer graphics, more specically 2D/3D animation and NPR, where I can work alongside artists to provide them with new innovative tools and creative freedom.
